# excelWork

This is some excel macros and form i made.
1. the combine workbooks bas file combines all open 1 page workbooks into one workbook with multiple pages. it names each page based on the cell A:4. This is for reports i have at work that i pull that have one page for each workbook and a standard setup.
2. the show form bas file pulls up the compare tool form.
3. the compare tool form just has 2 boxes for file names. it takes those files based on the names you give and compares the 2 files. It highlightes differences in the two workbooks. It does go through each worksheet on each workbook for comparison. I use this at work to compare testing enviroment and production to make sure everything is the same in the setup.
